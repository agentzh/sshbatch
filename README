NAME
    SSH::Batch - Cluster operations based on parallel SSH, set and interval
    arithmetic

SYNOPSIS
    The following scripts are provided:

    fornodes
        Expand patterns to machine host list.

            $ cat > ~/.fornodesrc
            ps=blah.ps.com bloo.ps.com boo[2-25,32,41-70].ps.com
            as=ws[1101-1105].as.com
            # use set operations to define new sets:
            foo={ps} + {ps} * {as} - {ps} / {as}
             bar = foo.com bar.org \
                bah.cn \
                baz.com
            ^D

            $ fornodes 'api[02-10].foo.bar.com' 'boo*.ps.com'
            $ fornodes 'tq[ab-ac].[1101-1105].foo.com'
            $ fornodes '{ps} + {as} - ws1104.as.com'  # set union and subtraction
            $ fornodes '{ps} * {as}'  # set intersect

    atnodes
        Run command on clusters. (atnodes calls fornodes internally.)

            # run a command on the specified servers:
            $ atnodes $'ps -fe|grep httpd' 'ws[1101-1105].as.com'

            # multiple-arg command requires "--":
            $ atnodes ls /opt/ -- '{ps} + {as}' 'localhost'

            # or use single arg command:
            $ atnodes 'ls /opt/' '{ps} + {as}' 'localhost' # ditto

            # specify a different user name and SSH server port:
            $ atnodes hostname '{ps}' -u agentz -p 12345

            # use -w to prompt for password if w/o SSH key (no echo back)
            $ atnodes hostname '{ps}' -u agentz -w

            # or prompt for password if sudo required...
            $ atnodes 'sudo apachectl restart' '{ps}' -w

            # or specify a timeout:
            $ atnodes 'ping foo.com' '{ps}' -t 3

    tonodes
        Upload local files/directories to remote clusters

            $ tonodes /tmp/*.inst -- '{as}:/tmp/'
            $ tonodes foo.txt 'ws1105*' :/tmp/bar.txt

            # use rsync instead of scp:
            $ tonodes foo.txt 'ws1105*' :/tmp/bar.txt -rsync

            $ tonodes -r /opt /bin/* -- 'ws[1101-1102].foo.com' 'bar.com' :/foo/bar/

    key2nodes
        Push the SSH public key (or generate one if not any) to the remote
        clusters.

            $ key2nodes 'ws[1101-1105].as.com'

DESCRIPTION
    System administration (sysadmin) is also part of my $work. Playing with
    a (big) bunch of machines without a handy tool is painful. So I
    refactored some of our old scripts and hence this module.

    This is a high-level abstraction over the powerful Net::OpenSSH module.
    A bunch of handy scripts are provided to simplify big cluster
    operations: fornodes, atnodes, tonodes, and key2nodes.

    "SSH::Batch" allows you to name your clusters using variables and
    interval/set syntax in your ~/.fornodesrc config file. For instance:

        $ cat ~/.fornodesrc
        A=foo[01-03].com bar.org
        B=bar.org baz[a-b,d,e-g].cn foo02.com
        C={A} * {B}
        D={A} - {B}

    where cluster "C" is the intersection set of cluster "A" and "B" while
    "D" is the sef of machines that are in "A" but not in "B".

    And then you can query machine host list by using "SSH::Batch"'s
    fornodes script:

       $ fornodes '{C}'
       bar.org foo02.com

       $ fornodes '{D}'
       foo01.com foo03.com

       $ fornodes blah.com '{C} + {D}'
       bar.org blah.com foo01.com foo02.com foo03.com

    It's always best practice to put spaces around set operators like "+",
    "-", "*", and "/", so as to allow these characters (notably the dash
    "-") in your host names, as in:

      $ fornodes 'foo-bar-[a-d].com - foo-bar-c.com'
      foo-bar-a.com foo-bar-b.com foo-bar-d.com

    for the ranges like "[a-z]", there's also an alternative syntax:

       [a..z]

    To exclude some discrete values from certain range, you need set
    subtration:

       foo[1-100].com - foo[32,56].com

    or equivalently

       foo[1-31,33-55,57-100].com

    fornodes could be very handy in shell programming. For example, to test
    the 80 port HTTP service of a cluster "A", simply put

     $ for node in `fornodes '{A}'`; \
         do curl "http://$node:80/blah'; \
       done

    Also, other scripts in this module, like atnodes, tonodes, and key2nodes
    also call fornodes internally so that you can use the cluster spec
    syntax in those scripts' command line as well.

    atnodes meets the common requirement of running a command on a remote
    cluster. For example:

      # at the concurrency level of 6:
      atnodes 'ls -lh' '{A} + {B}' my.more.com -c 6

    Or upload a local file to the remote cluster:

      tonodes ~/my.tar.gz '{A} / {B}' :/tmp/

    or multiple files as well as some directories:

      tonodes -r ~/mydir ~/mydir2/*.so -- foo.com bar.cn :~/

    It's also possible to use wildcards in the cluster spec expression, as
    in

      atnodes 'ls ~' 'api??.*.com'

    where atnodes will match the pattern "api??.*.com" against the
    "universal set" consisting of those hosts appeared in ~/fornodesrc and
    those host names apeared before this pattern on the command line (if
    any). Note that only "?" (match any character) and "*" (match 0 or more
    characters) are supported here.

    There's also a key2nodes script to push SSH public keys to remote
    machines ;)

TIPS
    There's some extra tips found in our own's everyday use:

    Running sudo commands
        Often, we want to run commands requiring root access, such as when
        installing software packages on remote machines. So you'll have to
        tell atnodes to prompt for your password:

          $ atnodes 'sudo yum install blah' '{my_cluster}' -w

        Then you'll be prompted by the "Password:" prompt after which you
        enter your remote password (with echo back turned off).

        Because the remote sshd might be smart enough to "remember" the sudo
        password for a (small) amount of time, immediate subsequent "sudo"
        might omit the "-w" option, as in

          $ atnodes 'sudo mv ~/foo /usr/local/bin/' {my_cluster}

        But remember, you can use *sudo without passwords* just for a
        *small* amount of time ;)

    Passing custom options to the underlying "ssh"
        By default, "atnodes" relies on Net::OpenSSH to locate the OpenSSH
        client executable "ssh". But you can define the "SSH_BATCH_SSH_CMD"
        environment to specify the command explicitly. You can use the
        "-ssh" option to override it further.

        Note that to specify your own "ssh" is also a way to pass more
        options to the underlying OpenSSH client executable when using
        "atnodes":

            $ cat > ~/bin/myssh
            #!/bin/sh
            # to enable X11 forwarding:
            exec ssh -X "$@"

            $ chmod +x ~/bin/myssh

            $ export SSH_BATCH_SSH_CMD=~/bin/myssh
            $ atnodes 'ls -lh' '{my_cluster_name}'

        It's important to use "exec" in your own ssh wrapper script, or you
        may see "atnodes" hangs.

    Use wildcard for cluster expressions to save typing
        Wildcards in cluster spec could save a lot of typing. Say, if you
        have "api10.foo.bar.baz.bah.com.cn" appeared in your ~/.fornodesrc
        file:

          $ cat ~/.fornodesrc
          MyCluster=api[01-22].foo.bar.baz.bah.com.cn

        then in case you want to refer to the "api10.foo.bar.baz.bah.com.cn"
        node alone on the command line, you can just say "api10*", or
        "api10.*.com.cn", or something more specific.

        But use wildcards with care. You may have nodes that you don't want
        in your resulting host list. So it's best practice to use -l option
        when you use wildcards with atnodes or tonodes, as in

          $ atnodes 'rm -rf /opt/blah' 'api10*' -l

        So that atnodes will just echos out the exact host list that it
        would operate on but without doing anything. (It's effectively a
        "dry-run".) After checking, you can safely remove the "-l" option
        and go on.

    Specify a different ssh port or user name.
        You may have already learned that you can use the "-u" and "-p"
        options to specify a non-default user account or SSH port. But it's
        also possible and often more convenient to put it as part of your
        cluster spec expression, either in ~/.fornodesrc or on the command
        line, as in

            $ cat > ~/.fornodesrc
            # cluster A uses the default user name:
            A=foo[01-25].com
            # cluster B uses the non-default user name "jim" and a port 12345
            B=jim@foo[26-28].com:12345

            $ atnodes 'ls -lh' '{B} + bob@bar[29-31].org:5678'

    Use "-L" to help grepping the outputs by hostname
        When managing hundreds or even thousands of machines, it's often
        more convenient to "grep" over the outputs of atnodes or tonodes by
        host names. The "-L" option makes atnodes and tonodes to prefixing
        every output lines of the remote commands (if any) by the host name.
        As in

          $ atnodes 'top -b|head -n5' '{my_big_cluster}' -L > out.txt 2>&1
          $ grep 'some.specific.host.com' out.txt

    Specify a timeout to prevent hanging
        It's often wise to specify a timeout for SSH operations. For
        example, if there's 3 sec of network traffic silence, the following
        command will quit with an error message printed:

          $ atnodes -t 3 'sleep 4' {my_cluster}

    Limit the bandwith used by tonodes to be firewall-friendly
        You can use the "-b" option to tell tonodes to use limited bandwidth
        if your intranet's Firewall is paranoid about your bandwidth use:

          $ tonodes my_big_file {my_cluster}:/tmp/ -b 8000

        where 8000 is in the unit of Kbits/sec, so it will not transfer
        faster than 1 MByte/sec.

PREREQUISITES
    This module uses Net::OpenSSH behind the scene, so it requires the
    OpenSSH *client* executable (usually spelled "ssh") with multiplexing
    support (at least OpenSSH 4.1). To check your "ssh" version, use the
    command:

        $ ssh -v

    On my machine, it echos

        OpenSSH_4.7p1 Debian-8ubuntu1.2, OpenSSL 0.9.8g 19 Oct 2007
        usage: ssh [-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxY] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec]
                   [-D [bind_address:]port] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile]
                   [-i identity_file] [-L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport]
                   [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port] [-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-S ctl_path]
                   [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] [user@]hostname [command]

    There's no spesial requirement on the server side ssh service. Even a
    non-OpenSSH server-side deamon should work as well.

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        sudo make install

    Win32 users should replace "make" with "nmake".

SOURCE CONTROL
    You can always get the latest SSH::Batch source from its public Git
    repository:

        http://github.com/agentzh/sshbatch/tree/master

    If you have a branch for me to pull, please let me know ;)

TODO
    *   Cache the parsing and evaluation results of the config file
        ~/.fornodesrc to somewhere like the fiel ~/.fornodesrc.cached.

    *   Abstract the duplicate code found in the scripts to a shared .pm
        file.

    *   Add the fromnodes script to help downloading files from the remote
        clusters to local file system (maybe grouped by host name).

    *   Add the "betweennodes" script to transfer files between clusters
        through localhost.
